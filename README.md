### Abstract
Action Quality Assessment (AQA)—the task of quantifying how well an action is performed—has great potential for detecting errors in gym weight training, where accurate feedback is critical to prevent injuries and maximize gains. Existing AQA datasets, however, are limited to single-view competitive sports and RGB video, lacking multimodal signals and professional assessment of fitness actions. We introduce FLEX, the first large-scale, multimodal, multiview dataset for fitness AQA that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG). FLEX contains over 7,500 multi-view recordings of 20 weight-loaded exercises performed by 38 subjects of diverse skill levels, with synchronized RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological signals. Expert annotations are organized into a Fitness Knowledge Graph (FKG) linking actions, key steps, error types, and feedback, supporting a compositional scoring function for interpretable quality assessment. FLEX enables multimodal fusion, cross-modal prediction—including the novel Video→EMG task—and biomechanically oriented representation learning. Building on the FKG, we further introduce FLEX-VideoQA, a structured question–answering benchmark with hierarchical queries that drive cross-modal reasoning in vision–language models. Baseline experiments demonstrate that multimodal inputs, multi-view video, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance AQA performance. FLEX thus advances AQA toward richer multimodal settings and provides a foundation for AI-powered fitness assessment and coaching.

### Key Words
action quality assessment, fitness, action understanding, video understanding

### NeurIPS Review Results
We sincerely thank the NeurIPS reviewers for their hard work and valuable feedback. FLEX received positive and competitive evaluations during the review process (Rating: 5,5,5,4 on a 6-point scale), but was not ultimately accepted due to the conference’s overall arrangements.
